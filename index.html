  <h3>A bit about me!</h3>
  <p>Call me Matt! I’m currently 17, with my birthday on June 25th, and I graduated from year 12 at Suzanne Cory High School in Hoppers Crossing; currently studying IT to get into the cybersecurity field. I grew up in Australia, but I am Filipino, mainly from the regions of Cebu and Leyte where they speak Binisaya. It’s a dialect in the Philippines. I used to be a Music Captain at my high school, but I loved working on the more technical sides (amps, mics and whatnot). A fun fact about me is I used to do longboarding, which is essentially a wider skateboard used for cruising. It’s excellent for breezing around in open spaces and is much smoother and quicker than a regular skateboard. Down below is the one that I use.</p>

  <h2> &#128173; Interest in IT &#128173;</h2>
    <h3>What am I passionate about?</h3>
      <p>My main interest in IT was mainly cybersecurity and IT ethics. My sister often told me stories about her friend as a security engineer. It always intrigued me how people could develop ways to obtain information and data in a way I could never comprehend. This festered inside me since I had a deep obsession with the aspects of the Dark Web and the Deep Web, and I always wanted to explore them myself but realised I needed to protect myself first. So, I wanted to learn how cybersecurity and IT, in general, worked as I liked working with any technology and wanted to understand how cybersecurity could be helpful in the modern world. The idea that there are people who protect data and engage in “cyber warfares” to protect against cybercrime fascinated me and appealed to my nerdier side of my love for technology. I was always keen to work in a job where I would be surrounded by tech, and I now have that opportunity.</p>
    <h3>My experiences in IT</h3>
      <p>My sister often explained how her friend worked in an IT security team for a bank that often required them regularly test the defence and various methods that could be used to gain sensitive information. One such example was my friend’s team (the red team) offered a mail to the administration desk with a USB inside tagged “insert into the computer”, which they did as instructed. This caused a shutdown across the bank’s network and prompted the bank to give stricter rules to the administration team. Hearing about this often made me laugh, but I remember I downloaded a DS 3D emulator as a child, which turned out to be a virus. So hearing these kinds of stories made me wonder if I could do something to prevent such things as a virus or malware attacking a computer and fix the thing that I usually broke.</p>

    <h3>But...why RMIT?</h3>
      <p>I chose RMIT because I discovered it was a great place if you wanted to take computer science-based subjects. My sister also went to RMIT and found it easier if I chose a university that I knew someone went to before to get prior knowledge. But RMIT also offered me the most direct course that I wanted to take to become cybersecurity at the expense of transport and city convenience. Other universities had fuzzy systems; some offered it but with add-ons or were too far to reach. RMIT also provided an exciting course outline that I could understand and rationalise without wondering if it was worth it.</p>
    <h3>What I want out of this</h3>
      <p>I hope to learn everything there is to IT. I want to feel confident in the IT field and pick up some things that might be useful along the way. I have been excited to learn to code and practice new techniques that could adapt to any project whilst being proficient at the required task. But I would also like to develop a new understanding of the concepts about security and ethics in the industry to grasp the field of cybersecurity.</p>

  <h2>&#128170; Ideal Job &#128170;</h2>
    <h3>My job would be...</h3>
      <p> My ideal job in the IT field would be a Chief Information Security Officer;</p>
      <br>
      <p>A Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is an executive tasked with the management, enforcement and progression of an information security program. They consider possible internal and external threats to communications, data, programs and assets, finding solutions to prevent breaches in security. This can range from policies and system administration to managing IT teams and procedures. This particular job type resonates with me as I often would like to handle leadership positions like a senior executive whilst still being able to design, test and improve security measures. Being able to bring influence to organisations and governing bodies through IT-know-how has been such an enormous appeal to me. Especially with the growing concern for security within the virtual world, becoming a part of such an industry that I find so influential strikes me as a fun and meaningful career.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

    <h3>What does it require?</h3>
      <p>Chief Information Security Officers have many qualifications and skills required to handle such a position. So, it’s essential to understand that multiple years of experience in IT security, especially in an administrative/leadership position, is a prime factor in achieving the job. Experience in business management, security risk management and knowledge of cybersecurity tech and procedures are such vital components. Thus, they need to provide insights into potential growth and limitations to their organisations through their study and experience with computer software and hardware. Strong analytical thinking combined with interpersonal and communication skills allows CISOs to work across the field with various employees to create cohesiveness and efficacy whilst communicating on a business level from a technical perspective. Developing and enforcing incident produces to prevent intrusions with audits, and reports iterate how CISOs must have critical thinking abilities to improve a company’s security.</p>
    <h3>Do I have anything...?</h3>
      <p>I currently have no experience that correlates with this field or job. Regarding my skill set and qualifications, the most I can relate to was a short course in HTML and CSS that I took years ago; however, this only acts as the basic bones for my ability to comprehend coding and IT concepts.</p>

    <h3>My Journey... (one of the possibilities)</h3>
      <p>To attain such a high-level position, years of experience and dedication to the field are required. After graduation with a relevant degree, I could start with an entry-level position like a:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Security Admin</li>
          <li>Network or Systems Admin</li>
        </ul>
      <p>This can later move on to more technical positions such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Security analyst or engineer</li>
          <li>Penetration Tester</li>
          <li>Security Consultant</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Ideally, the next step would be to attain a senior position that would build on skills related to leadership and project management like:
    <ul>
        <li>Security Manager </li>
        <li>IT Project Manager </li>
        <li>Security Architect or Director </li>
      </ul>
    <p>Moving through such positions would allow me to build on the technical experience before developing them and applying it with communicative and leadership skills to target the role of CISO.</p>

  <h2> &#129504; Personality Profile &#129504;</h2>
    <h3>My personality in a nutshell</h3>
      <p>Compiling together all the data gathered from the three tests; has permitted me to evaluate my capabilities and limitations as a person. The Myers-Briggs test showed that I am an INFP-T known as a meditator. This highlights that I am a strong empath, able to sense and communicate what those around me feel or think; thus, I am capable of being open-minded idealistic. But I am also prone to procrastination and highly self-critical of my faults whilst being unrealistic of my expectations. The Myers Brigg test is designed to assess an individual’s strengths and weaknesses to reflect where their skill set is most valuable and impactful. The learning style test showcased that I am a tactile/kinetic learner, meaning I learn best by doing it, breaking down tasks and examples to understand them better. I find this useful to learning IT as it’s a very hands-on field, and picking up skills such as coding and website set-ups can develop as I break down my mistakes and practice them to improve. The Big Five test measures five traits; Neurotic, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness. My results assess that I’m more prone to negative feelings, more towards being creative and imaginative and more involved with cooperation and social harmony. These results resemble the Myer-Briggs test of being open-minded and valuing agreement, highlighting my weakness of being prone to anxiety, self-doubt, and lack of social engagement or self-control.</p>

    <h3>What does this say about me?</h3>
      <p>These current results indicate that I would a be strong team player, able to provide support and guidance, yet I would be vulnerable to self-doubt and procrastination. In a team setting, I would be much more interested in a team that actively engages with each other rather than self mediated tasks assigned to various members. Because I tend to be agreeable, if arguments break out, I would be stressed as I’d be more focused on the people rather than the task at hand. While these results depict my role and impact in a team, I believe that this encourages me to be more aware of my involvement and work ethic as to not fall behind in the group and not overwhelm myself with others’ burdens that are not directly affecting me or in my jurisdiction to act. I am an emotional person who can communicate empathetically, ensuring that the people I work with are people I enjoy working with..</p>

    <h3>TEAM STRATS!</h3>
      <p>When forming a team, I should consider people who can support my shortcomings and not dissuade me from participation. I should be careful if I take a leadership position or role as my personality tests indicate that my management capability could be hindered by my idealism and expectations with my colleagues. Ideally, I can be a more effective and productive member if I can find people with whom I can communicate well and provide guidance. Working with optimistic people is also a strong choice as it means I’m more willing to listen to criticisms.</P>

    <h3>Can we trust this?</h3>
      <p>Overall, the validity of each of these tests can be attributed to a grain of salt. Personality tests help indicate and interpret possible employees or colleagues. Still, they are not the defining factor in who that person is or how they will act in various scenarios. Such tests are a broad spectrum, and people can change depending on variables that may or not may be within our given control. So, we have to take each test with hesitancy and should not be constricted by what we get</p>

  <h1>Project idea</h1>
    <h3>Outline</h3>
      <p>The IT project, Double Check, is a web extension designed to screen and simplify a website’s terms and conditions and can be applied when the user wants to check without scanning and reading each clause. The extension will compile each clause into bullet points that, when toggle, can describe to the user what they mean in layman’s terms with an example. The bullets can then be sent to an email as a document for easier reading and review. Overall, the web extension will be designed to provide more security and comfort to the users in handling a tedious task in a simple manner.</p>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3947022/COSC1078/main/s3947022/main/Icon.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABSVJFGJYDLBYVC4LKLPEAWYYSFJLMA" class = "center">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>In such a digitised world, we heavily rely on platforms to carry out our daily needs and wants; yet there are still huge risks to companies and customers. Privacy and data protection are increasingly becoming difficult mediums to regulate and utilise without avoiding possibilities of failure, being compromised or even extortion. According to an article published in 2018 on <a href="https://theconversation.com/94-of-australians-do-not-read-all-privacy-policies-that-apply-to-them-and-thats-rational-behaviour-96353" target="_blank">the Conversation</a> that 94% of Australians do not read all privacy policies that apply to them. Yet we do not have the time to even read through half of them as it would take 244 hours for the average person to work through each term and condition that would apply to them and even more to check when a website has changed theirs. The Consumer Policy Research Centre’s report stated that while 91% of Australians are okay with services using their personal data for business reasons, 95% of Australians would also like options to avoid data collection. It is not surprising with the number of people but rather how many become affected or fall victim to it. And in the wake of the recent scandal involving breaches in privacy with Facebook in 2019 with 533 million peoples’ data published on a hacking forum; users should be more attentive and knowledgeable about how their data is being used by companies and other platforms. Thus, Double-Check would provide support and comfort in protecting users’ data and privacy with a simple reading task in an easier process.</p>

    <h3>Breakdown</h3>
      <p>Double Check would be a downloadable web extension that allows users to summarise any term and conditions document. Once turned on and met with its first task, it would scan through clauses, looking for common phrases and target essential details such as access and usage to users’ data or privacy. Once completed, the document will be summed up into bullet points that the user can click on to view what that particular clause would intend for the user. It could provide a possible example or even highlight obvious potential risks that might be considered to be vital to them. Such valuables could be phone contacts, messages, device ID, location, social networks, or browsing history. The user can double click to be taken to the specific clause in question so that the user can screenshot it or even read it thoroughly. If the web extension cannot recognise the text as the terms and conditions, the user can instead copy it to an online document like Google Docs so the extension can scan it. This will be utilised by checking off a box to enable the web extension to access and scan such online documents. Finally, the web extension will ask the user whether they would like a word document with all the bullet points and summaries sent to their email so they can print, store or review the scanned terms and conditions. Add-ons could include bringing up first specified topics or essential details such as user access and personal information usage to allow users to pick and choose relevant concerns that apply to them. Another could also include screenshots of those clauses alongside the document with the bullet points to be sent to the users’ emails.</p>
    <h3>Tools</h3>
      <p>The tools required to build Double Check would most likely need various coding software such as HTML or Javascript. But the leading software would have to be able to scan, read, interpret and provide feedback to users to ensure that they can comprehend what terms and conditions are being presented to them. A coding program called common lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language, could be utilised to read the text and interpret the meaning for the user. Lisp is known as list processing and is used to manipulate data strings; commonly used for artificial intelligence programming. Common Lisp is used in the famous web extension, app and browser: Grammarly, which scans, reads and helps users with texts that they write. Its strengths are processing speed and compilation rate, which would have to be considered to keep up with ever-changing terms and conditions.</p>

      </div>

    <h3>Skills and Qualifications</h3>
      <p>Essential skills required would be knowledge in Lisp, HTML, CSS and Javascript programs. This is essentially what is only needed; however, it would be a bit of a challenge to find people well versed in Lisp as it’s an old programming code and is specific with its usage, thus limiting who might be able to program with it and who could help with writing the code for Double Check. Accessing such coding programs and implementation is much easier as Lisp programs are a language specification and are free and open-source with easy access. This would also apply to the various program that would be used in the construction of Double Check.</p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>If the IT project is successful, it would mean users would be able to feel more comfortable and secure about their data privacy and even create greater awareness online about the possible tricks and dangers of terms and conditions. It would also encourage companies to consider what they put in their policies and what they should be allowed to access versus what rights the user has. Ultimately, this application intends to amend a common concern about what companies can do with people and highlights who and what has privileges to various personal data. It could ensure that more users will have “read” the terms and conditions and will have fully understood what it entails for them.</p>
